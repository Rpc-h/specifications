== Introduction

== Concept

The fundamental interaction between a wallet and an RPC provider follows a simple
request-response pattern (see <<rpc1-img>>).

1. The wallet makes an RPC request to the RPC provider.
2. The RPC provider returns the RPC response.

Because the requests come directly from the wallet, the RPC provider has access
to each requests metadata, which includes IP address information. The data from
multiple requests can be combined to create even more specific data points for a
particular wallet.

RPCh changes that interaction such that it acts as an indirection between the
wallet and RPC provider.

As a result the RPC provider doesn't have direct access to a wallet's metadata
anymore, reducing the actionable insight an RPC provider can gain out-of-the-box.

== Goals

The general benefit of using RPCh is the decoupling of the service an RPC
provider performs for a wallet from its ability to gather actioable
knowledge on that wallet's behaviour. This ensures that irrespective of what RPC
provider a wallet chooses to use, it can be assured that metadata of its
requests isn't leaked towards the RPC provider in use.

Moreover, the following set of goals are set for RPCh:

1. RPC providers cannot access IP-level metadata of wallets.
1. RPC providers cannot directly infer knowledge by analyzing multiple
sequential requests.
1. Usage of RPCh must be free for wallets.
1. Any RPC provider can be used through RPCh as long as it adheres to the
standard Ethereum JSON-RPC API. This is further referred to as BYOP
(Bring-your-own-provider).

== Requirements

1. Final RPC requests towards RPC provider must NOT be made by wallets.
1. Final RPC requests towards RPC provider must NOT be made different nodes.
1. Funding of RPCh through external parties.
1. RPC providers must be configurable per-request.
